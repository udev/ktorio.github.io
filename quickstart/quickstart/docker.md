[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a container platform:
it allows packaging software in a format that can then be run in isolation in any supported operating system.

Publishing a Ktor application to docker is very easy and only takes a few steps:

* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* A JAR packaging tool

In this page we will guide you through creating a docker image and publishing an application to it.

## Package an application using Gradle

In this tutorial, we will use the Gradle [shadow plugin](https://github.com/johnrengelman/shadow).
It packages all the output classes, resources, and all the required dependencies into a single JAR file,
and appends a manifest file to tell Java which is the entry-point main class containing the main method. 

First, you need to add the shadow plugin dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy 
buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    }
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath "com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins:shadow:5.1.0"
    }
}
```

After that, you have to apply it, along with the application plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: "com.github.johnrengelman.shadow"
apply plugin: 'application'
``` 

Then specify the main class, so it knows what to run when running the java's JAR inside Docker:

```groovy
mainClassName = 'org.sample.ApplicationKt'
```

The string is the fully qualified name of the class containing your `main` function. When `main` function is a top-level
function in a file, the class name is the file name with the `Kt` suffix. In the example above, `main` function is in the
file `Application.kt` in package `org.sample`.

Finally, you have to configure the shadow plugin:

```groovy
shadowJar {
    baseName = 'my-application'
    classifier = null
    version = null
}
```

Now you can run `./gradlew build` to build and package your application.
You should get `my-application.jar` in `build/libs` folder.  

For more information about configuring this plugin see [documentation for the plugin](http://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/)

So a full `build.gradle` file would look like this:


{% capture build-gradle %}
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '{{site.kotlin_version}}'
    ext.ktor_version = '{{site.ktor_version}}'
    ext.logback_version = '1.2.3'
    ext.slf4j_version = '1.7.25'
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        classpath "com.github.jengelman.gradle.plugins:shadow:2.0.1"
    }
}

apply plugin: 'kotlin'
apply plugin: "com.github.johnrengelman.shadow"
apply plugin: 'application'

mainClassName = "io.ktor.server.netty.EngineMain"

sourceSets {
    main.kotlin.srcDirs = [ 'src' ]
    main.resources.srcDirs = [ 'resources' ]
}

repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:$kotlin_version"
    compile "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version"
    compile "io.ktor:ktor-html-builder:$ktor_version"
    compile "ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:$logback_version"
}

kotlin.experimental.coroutines = 'enable'

shadowJar {
    baseName = 'my-application'
    classifier = null
    version = null
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture resources-application-conf %}
```groovy
ktor {
    deployment {
        port = 8080
    }

    application {
        modules = [ io.ktor.samples.hello.HelloApplicationKt.main ]
    }
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% capture src-hello-application-kt %}
```kotlin
package io.ktor.samples.hello

import io.ktor.application.*
import io.ktor.features.*
import io.ktor.html.*
import io.ktor.routing.*
import kotlinx.html.*

fun Application.main() {
    install(DefaultHeaders)
    install(CallLogging)
    routing {
        get("/") {
            call.respondHtml {
                head {
                    title { +"Ktor: jetty" }
                }
                body {
                    p {
                        +"Hello from Ktor Jetty engine sample application"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include tabbed-code.html
    tab1-title="build.gradle" tab1-content=build-gradle
    tab2-title="resources/application.conf" tab2-content=resources-application-conf
    tab3-title="src/HelloApplication.kt" tab3-content=src-hello-application-kt
%}

## Prepare Docker image

In the root folder of your project create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following contents:

{% capture dockerfile %}{% include docker-sample.md %}{% endcapture %}
{% include tabbed-code.html
    tab1-title="Dockerfile" tab1-content=dockerfile
    no-height="true"
%}

Let's see what is what:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
```

This line tells Docker to base an image on a pre-built image with [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/). You can use other images 
from [OpenJDK registry](https://hub.docker.com/_/openjdk/). Alpine Linux benefit is that the image is pretty small. 
We also select JRE-only image since we don't need to compile code on the image, only run precompiled classes.

```dockerfile
RUN mkdir /app
COPY ./build/libs/my-application.jar /app/my-application.jar
WORKDIR /app
```

These lines copy your packaged application into the Docker image and sets the working directory to where we copied it.

```dockerfile
CMD ["java", "-server", "-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions", "-XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap", "-XX:InitialRAMFraction=2", "-XX:MinRAMFraction=2", "-XX:MaxRAMFraction=2", "-XX:+UseG1GC", "-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100", "-XX:+UseStringDeduplication", "-jar", "my-application.jar"]
```

The last line instructs Docker to run `java` with G10s GC, 4G of memory and your packaged application. 

## Building and running the Docker image

Build an application package:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Build and tag an image:

```bash
docker build -t my-application .
```

Start an image:

```bash
docker run -m512M --cpus 2 -it -p 8080:8080 --rm my-application
```

With this command, we start Docker in a foreground mode. It will wait for the server to exit, it
will also respond to `Ctrl+C` to stop it. `-it` instructs Docker to allocate a terminal (*tty*) to pipe the stdout
and to respond to the interrupt key sequence. 

Since our server is running in an isolated container now, we should tell Docker to expose a port so we can
actually access the server port. Parameter `-p 8080:8080` tells Docker to publish port 8080 from inside a container as a port 8080 on a local
machine. Thus, when you tell your browser to visit `localhost:8080` it will first reach out to Docker, and it will bridge
it into internal port `8080` for your application. 

You can adjust memory with `-m512M` and number of exposed cpus with `--cpus 2`. 

By default a containerâ€™s file system persists even after the container exits, so we supply `--rm` option to prevent
garbage piling up.

For more information about running a docker image please consult [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run) 
documentation.

## Pushing docker image 

Once your application is running locally successfully, it might be a time to deploy it:

```bash
docker tag my-application hub.example.com/docker/registry/tag
docker push hub.example.com/docker/registry/tag
```
 
These commands will tag your application for a registry and push an image. 
Of course, you need to replace `hub.example.com/docker/registry/tag` with an actual URL for your registry.

We won't go into details here since your configuration might require authentication, specific configuration options 
and even special tools. Please consult your organization or cloud platform, or 
check [docker push](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push/) documentation.
